    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an introductory tutorial to Q-learning. Specifically, we will implement tabular Q-Learning in JAX and use it to steer a simplified brittle star robot toward a target location. The [brittle star robot and its environment](https://github.com/Co-Evolve/brt/tree/main/biorobot/brittle_star) is part of the [**the Bio-inspired Robotics Testbed (BRT)**](https://github.com/Co-Evolve/brt). Instead of directly outputting joint-level motor commands, we will use our Q-learning controller to select motion primitives from a predefined set. These motion primitives were the final result of the CPG tutorial and are simplified rowing gaits that differentiate based on the leading arm. In essence, our Q-learning controller will thus learn how to map the brittle star's state to the correct leading arm to steer it toward a target location. \n",

    "The main goal of this tutorial is to give you a practical example that you can play around with to gain intuition in the fundamental design choices of reinforcement learning experiments (state representations, action definitions, reward definitions, etc.)."

    "## Q-Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Q-learning belongs to the class of [model-free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-free_(reinforcement_learning)) reinforcement algorithms. This means that the algorithm does not require prior knowledge (i.e. a model) of the environment. It also belongs to the class of off-policy algorithms, meaning that it does not use the 'current policy' to produce actions at every timestep.\n",
    "\n",
    "As its name entails, the algorithm's goal is to learn the function $Q(s, a)$, which represents the expected cumulative reward for taking a particular action $a$ in a given state $s$. In other words, we try to learn a function that predicts the expected payoff of doing a certain action in a given state. Given such a function, we can select the action with the highest expected payoff in every state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will focus on tabular Q-learning. This means that our $Q(s, a)$ function is implemented as a table with discretized states as rows and discretized actions as columns. After a successful optimization, each cell in this table will approximate the Q-value of a state and an action. To get a good action given some state, we can then just select the action that corresponds to the highest Q-value of the row indexed by the discretized state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, this Q-Table will be populated with zeros or small random values (small random values giving the additional benefit of encouraging some extra initial exploration). The Q-Learning algorithm then tries to optimize the values in this table through an iterative process of exploration and exploitation. During the exploration phase, the agent will take random actions to get information about the environment and update the Q-Table accordingly. As the agent explores more, it gradually transitions into the exploitation phase, where it leverages the learned Q-values to make more informed decisions and maximize the cumulative reward further.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tabular Q-learning algorithm can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "1. Initialize the Q-table with arbitrary values or zeros.\n",
    "2. Observe the current state $s$ of the environment.\n",
    "3. Choose an action $a$ to take based on an exploration-exploitation trade-off. This can for instance be done by using the epsilon-greedy approach, where the agent selects a random action with probability $\\epsilon$ (exploration) and chooses the action with the highest Q-value with a complementary probability $(1-\\epsilon)$ (exploitation).\n",
    "4. Perform the chosen action $a$, transition to the next state $s'$ and observe the reward $r$.\n",
    "5. Update the Q-Table of the state-action pair using the Q-learning update rule<br>\n",
    "        $Q(s,a) = (1 - \\alpha) Q(s,a) + \\alpha(r + \\gamma\\max_{a' \\in A}(Q(s', a')))$,<br>\n",
    "        where alpha $\\alpha$ is the learning rate, gamma $\\gamma$ is the discount factor that determines the importance of future rewards, $r$ is the immediate reward obtained (given by the environment), and $\\max_{a' \\in A}(Q(s', a'))$ represents the maximum Q-value for the next state\n",
    "6. Repeat steps $2$ to $5$ until convergence or a predefined number of iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A natural extension of the tabular Q-learning algorithm (which is limited to discrete actions and states) is the [Deep Q-Learning (DQN) algorithm](https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/unit3/introduction). As its name gives away, the DQN algorithm swaps the Q-table for a deep neural network, which enables mapping continuous states to $Q(s, a)$ values (the network will have one output neuron per action)."

    "### Experimental design\n",
    "\n",
    "Given our brittle star environment and task definition, we can now design our reinforcement learning setup. The three main components are the state representation, the actions, and the reward function. When experimenting with reinforcement learning, it is incredibly important to always maintain a very clear overview of these three components (and of course the environment/morphology configuration as well). When the learning fails or is slow, it is almost always one of these design choices that lies at the root of it (given that there are no bugs on the environment side).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### State representation\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important design choices when applying a Q-learning algorithm (and reinforcement learning algorithms in general), is how to represent the state. In other words, what kind of information do we supply to the policy to make it return good actions? Which observations that the environment returns do we use and do we transform them in some way to represent them better? When deciding on this, a good exercise is to imagine that you are the robot trying to solve the given task; Ask yourself what kind of information you would require. In this case, we also need a discretized state representation, since we're working with tabular Q-Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep things as simple as possible, in this tutorial, we will approach this locomotion task from a grid-based perspective. We will discretize the 2D aquarium floor in a 6x6 grid of square cells (one cell of this grid is equal to a small square that the rendered aquarium floor's texture above indicates). As a discrete state representation for this locomotion task with a fixed target location, we will take the index of the grid cell that the brittle star robot's disk is currently in. Take a moment to think about this state representation. If you were the robot, would this allow you to solve the task? \n",
    "\n",
    "Sidenote: During this project, we will always be using simulation environments. Simulation environments are nice since they give us full control over and full observability of everything in the environment (for instance the exact position of the brittle star's disk). In the real world, however, we do not get this for free. There we have to rely purely on sensory information (e.g. cameras, touch sensors, motor encoders...) and additional processing to get this kind of information (which is often noisy). Always keep this in mind, and even though we won't do a sim2real transfer during this project, always be able to explain how you would allow your selected state representation to be implemented on a real-world robot. For instance, in this grid-based representation, we could use a downwards-facing camera above the aquarium. Using some computer vision techniques, the brittle star's disk position can be extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "This next cell implements our grid-based state representation. We name the function 'state_indexer' as it extracts a row index for our Q-Table."

    "Given the CPG implementation above, we can now implement our 'action mapper', i.e. the function that maps a discrete action index (column in our Q-Table, which in this case indicates the leading arm) to the actuator-level control commands our environment expects.  To recap, our entire pipeline from environment observations to actuator controls will look like this:\n",

Given the environment configuration, the current control timestep is $0.04$ seconds (you can extract this using `environment_configuration.control_timestep`, the cell above also sets this as the time increment for our CPG's differential equation solver). This means that without any adaptations, we would re-modulate our CPG every $0.04$ seconds. Although this might be beneficial in a more complex environment, e.g. one in which there are obstacles that require faster adaptation, in this case, it makes the learning more difficult. During the exploration phase, the controller will output a lot of random actions. Consequently, if we re-modulate the CPG with a random action this frequently, we will switch between leading arms quite often and the robot will barely move. Therefore, when the policy proposes a leading arm index, we will always take $50$ environment steps with this same leading arm.\n"

We will use this reward because it gives a nice example of how important exploration is; If the agent does not explore well enough, it will never reach the target and thus never receive the positive reward. Consequently, it will never learn. The negative constant reward that is given at every timestep can be seen as a time penalty; I.e. the longer it takes for the agent to reach the goal, the smaller the total reward. This will stimulate our policy to reach the target as fast as possible.\n",

While we could also use a [jax.lax.while_loop](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.lax.while_loop.html) to allow early stopping, the general rule-of-thumb when using JAX effectively is to run loops for a fixed number of times.

One way to do so is to enrich the time penalty reward with the original environment's reward: the amount of distance the robot got closer to the target in this timestep compared to the previous timestep. If the robot then starts moving away from the target location, it will get penalized more and consequently, this reward provides a direct stimulation to move toward the target. So instead of relying on the exploration mechanism to randomly stumble on the positive reward, we let each state transition provide some more information."

Generally, there are two ways in which we can exploit vectorization in RL: (1) We can train multiple distinct agents in parallel (e.g. when we want to compare different hyperparameter settings or if we want to check if our method is stable with respect to stochasticity), or (2) We can train a single agent and parallelize over the rollouts (e.g. to increase data collection speed and increase exploration due to the increase in different trajectories).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we will go for option two and train one single agent using multiple rollouts. In this case, our rollout function also does policy updates. This means that if we vectorize it through `jax.vmap`, it will return a batch of different `QLearningPolicyParameters` with different versions of the Q-Table which we'll need to merge. In this case, we'll do this merge by averaging over the different versions."

    "In this tutorial we have implemented and applied a simple reinforcement learning technique, tabular Q-Learning, to steer a brittle star robot towards a fixed target location. Instead of directly outputting joint-level motor commands, we selected motion primitives from an archive of leading-arm-based gaits. \n",
    "\n",
    "Experimenting with this setup has shown us the importance of good state, action, and reward signal design. Reinforcement learning algorithms are commonly very fragile w.r.t. these design choices and their hyperparameters. Therefore, it's very important to always have a clear overview of all design choices made (this is incredibly helpful for you when debugging why something is not learning and necessary for others to be able to help you with it).\n",
    "\n",
    "While we already have quite a nice controller, this controller still lacks a lot of adaptability. What if for instance, the target is at a random position? What if the floor is not flat or the aquarium contains obstacles? What if we lose an arm? Throughout this project, you will iteratively try to increase your controller's adaptiveness. This will most often complexify the task that the controller must be able to do, requiring you to improve your reinforcement learning setup. At a certain point, this will require you to shift toward more advanced algorithms such as [Proximal Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347)."

    "In general: try to improve the learning as well as possible so that you can complexify the task. Always try to reason about and predict the influence of a certain modification before training, and compare your predictions with the actual results afterward! This is the best and fastest way to **improve your intuition, which is the main goal of this tutorial**!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Improve the logging\n",
    "    * Visualize an evaluation episode every $n$ rollout (with epsilon set to 0) and log the video on W&B. This will allow you to empirically analyze how the behavior changes over time (handy for debugging, and interesting to see).\n",
    "* Try to improve the training\n",
    "    * Make the state representation position independent (i.e. move away from the grid perspective). Position-dependent states (especially when working with a table) are often not the best way to represent the state, as there are a lot of options!\n",
    "    * Introduce variation in the target location.\n",
    "        * You will need to remove the target locotion argument from the `env.reset` function. \n",
    "        * You will need to adapt the state as this currently does not represent the target location.\n",
    "        * You can try to define a curriculum (start with an env that has its targets closer, then gradually increase the distance to the target).\n",
    "    * We currently set the hyperparameters (alpha, epsilon, gamma) ad hoc. Use JAX's vectorization capabilities to tune this.\n",
    "* Try to make the controller decentralized (i.e. instead of one controller that outputs an action for each arm, develop a controller architecture that has one controller per arm).\n",
    "    * The brittle star's nervous system is decentralized as well. Developing a decentralized controller will thus bring you one step closer to the biological system, making your controller slightly more 'bio-inspired'.\n",
    "    * You can share the controller's parameters between different arms (every arm must be able to do what every other arm does anyway, they just need to output different actions based on the different states they are in). You will thus need to make the states arm-specific.\n",
    "    * One possible approach:\n",
    "        * Arm-specific action: defines the role of the arm (leading arm, left rower, or right rower)\n",
    "        * Arm-specific state: angle between (1) the direction that the arm is pointing towards and (2) the direction towards the target\n",
    "        * You'll have to modify the CPG and its modulation function as well!\n",
    "* Try to optimise a controlelr that directly outputs joint-level motor commands. In other words: remove the CPG."
